        <p>"P. K. is a comedy of ideas about a stranger in the city, who asks questions that no one has asked before.
            They are innocent, child-like questions, but they bring about catastrophic answers. People who are set in
            their ways for generations, are forced to reappraise their world when they see it from PK's innocent eyes.
            In the process PK makes loyal friends and powerful foes. Mends broken lives and angers the establishment.
            P. K.'s childlike curiosity transforms into a spiritual odyssey for him and millions of others. The film is
            an ambitious and uniquely original exploration of complex philosophies. It is also a simple and humane tale
            of love, laughter and letting-go. Finally, it is a moving saga about a friendship between strangers from
            worlds apart."</p>

        <p> I’m Alex Cho and here is a quick summary of who I am, the values I hold, and ultimately the character that
            I am trying to live out. First, I aspire to live a Purpose Driven Life. This involves daily
            self-introspection, iterative goal planning, progress-oriented – how can I be 1% better than yesterday?</p>

        <p>Second, I am committed to being a Life-Long Learner. I believe, the day you stop learning is the day you
            die. I am very much alive ;). Most importantly and also the most costly… I strive to exercise Courageous
            Integrity: To uphold moral and ethical values and actions, meaning, forgoing short-term gains in
            expectation of long-term prosperity for all parties involved.</p>

        <p>As for interpersonal relationships, although its counter-intuitive and difficult, I commit to a Servant
            Leadership Mentality where I live to serve and bring value to the relationships in my life. Tactically, I
            live out the Inter / Independence Framework, that is, I strive to be a strong individual for the team,
            simultaneously, also be humble and be stronger as a team.</p>

        <p>Naturally, what follows is that I hold a Growth Mindset, seeing challenges as opportunities for personal &
            professional growth. As for Work Philosophy, I believe and act on these priorities: Work smart and then
            hard. Rest and sharpen the saw. Play and unwind. Do it again. </p>

        <p>Lastly, I try to have a strong Bias Towards Action, meaning I choose to not to lose my cool, get caught in
            excuses. Instead, I choose to exercise willpower to work towards positive actions versus dwelling on
            stagnant excuses.

            All of these values I hold ideally work together to achieve this ultimate value I strive to continually
            champion:

            Invest In Others: Choose to genuinely care and love other people, help them succeed. 爱人如己.</p>

        <p>To close, these are the values I strive to live day in and out. These values are hard and burdensome to
            uphold. It’s not easy and more often than not, I’ve failed to live them out.

            However, they act as a compass for excellence, not perfection. Ultimately, I choose to champion these
            values because they yield sustainable, lasting positive outcomes for myself and for those whose’s life
            journey collided with mine.
